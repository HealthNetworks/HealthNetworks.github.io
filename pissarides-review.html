<h3><a style = "text-decoration: none;" href="https://HealthNetworks.github.io/projects/primary_care_networks.html">Comparing registered and resident populations in Primary Care Networks in England: an observational study</a></h3>
<p>9th March 2022</p>
<p>Primary Care Networks (PCNs) are expected to be a building block for Integrated Care Systems but little is known about how they represent local communities. In this study we use publicly available data to identify how well PCNs footprints compare to where their patients live.</p>

  <h3><a style = "text-decoration: none;" href="https://HealthNetworks.github.io/projects/COATH.html">Evaluating the impact of a pulse oximetry remote monitoring programme on patients with Covid-19 in England</a></h3>
  <p>14th February 2022</p>
  <p>Pulse oximetry played an important role in the monitoring of patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. In this project we evaluated the impact of the national Covid Oximetry @home program in England. Over the course of several separate studies we examined the benefit of the program at the population level and the individual level and also looked at which patient groups were more likely to receive the intervention.</p>
