    <h1>The Pissarides Review into the Future of Work and Wellbeing</h1>
    <p>The Centre for Mathematics of Precision Healthcare (CMPH) in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London is part of a multi-university collaboration funded by the Nuffield Foundation to examine the impacts of technological disruption on people and communities across the UK and to ascertain the future of working practices and job skills in the UK.</p>
    <p>This £1.8M project (The ‘Pissarides Review’) is a 3-year collaboration between the London School of Economics, the Institute for the Future of Work (IFOW), Imperial College London and Warwick Business School, supported by the Nuffield Foundation and in collaboration also with economists at UCL. Grounded in the Nobel Prize Winning research of Principal Investigator Professor Chris Pissarides on frictions, the project involves a cross-disciplinary approach to evaluating disruption and modelling competing futures for work. The overarching purpose of the project is to help build a future of better work for the UK with a focus on building capabilities, strengthening resilience and reducing inequalities through better work.</p>

    <h2>Research areas</h2>
    <h3>Examining the changing skills requirements of the UK labour market</h3>
    <p>New technologies are changing the skills employers require of their workers. We use job postings data to investigate how skills are related to one another and how demand for skills is changing across occupations and regions of the UK.</p>
    <h3>Exploring regional variation in technological transformation</h3>
    <p>Through the Disruption Index, we examine how technological transformation may already be affecting parts of England differently, and how ready these regions are to adopt further new technologies in the years to come.</p>
    <h3>Studying the impact of new technologies on the wellbeing of workers</h3>
    <p>The introduction of new technologies across the labour market has the potential to fundamentally change relationships workers have with their jobs. In turn, this may have positive or negative effects on how satisfied workers are with their job, and their lives as a whole. We study how these changes to work may influence the wellbeing of workers.</p>

    <p>Bertha Rohenkohl, Jonathan M Clarke, Christopher Pissarides</p>
    <p>In this report we present the results of the Disruption Index, which examines how technological transformation may already be affecting parts of England differently, and how ready these regions are to adopt further new technologies in the years to come.</p>

    <p>Rui Costa, Zhaolu Liu, Christopher Pissarides, Bertha Rohenkohl</p>
    <p>In this report, we use a comprehensive dataset of online job postings from Adzuna, which provides information on the type of positions advertised and the skills that they require. We find rapid emergence of new skills and the disappearance of other, old skills. Notably, most skills becoming obsolete and new ones emerging to take their place, are related to IT. We quantify the magnitude and pace of skill change and find that it varies considerably across occupations. Occupations like IT directors, production engineers and cybersecurity professionals have experienced a high turnover of skill requirements, in contrast to slower-changing occupations, such as teaching, carpentry and several elementary trades.</p>
